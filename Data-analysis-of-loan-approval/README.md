### Project Overview

 In this project a data set of various loan applicants was analysed. First the data types were identified. Then null values were replaced by mode of the dataset. After cleaning the data, average loan amount, percentage loan approved were calculated. And then finally average income of an applicant and the average loan given was calculated.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt how to use python to deal with huge amount of data. I also learnt usage of numpy and pandas.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I did this project by using trial and error approach. This is very effective way to learn new things. Trying new ways to tackle problems often gives us solution to various other problems as well. 


### Challenges faced

 Since I am new to numpy and pandas I had difficulty in using them. For example I had a hard time calculating mode of the dataset and in the end I found out it was just a silly bracket mistake, which matters in python. Just like this I kept making mistakes and kept learning from those mistakes and thats how I overcame all the challanges in this project. 


### Additional pointers

 This project is very basic. It is just to create an understanding of how to deal with a dataset in python.
